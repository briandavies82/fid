<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called souis vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Holandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
